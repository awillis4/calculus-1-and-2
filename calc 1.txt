Calc 2 term 1.

1. Solve: S(2(x^3))-(x^4)dx|-2->2

2. Find the average value: f=1+cosx|0->pi

3. Sketch this region and compute its area: y=(x^2), f=2x

4. Solve: S(3lnx)/x)dx

5. A spring has a natural rest length of 10cm.

   The force required for the spring to reach 20cm in length is 6 joules.
   
   The force required for the spring to reach 30cm in length is ? joules.
   
   Find ?
   
6. Notice that y=(x^(1/2)) and f=(x^2).

   Rotate the region about the y axis once using washers and again using cylindrical shells.

   Compute and sketch this region using any method you prefer.
